## General rules for project grading:
* Groups are allowed 10 minutes to present their work.
* Groups are called to present their work based on a random number announced in the class. 
* One person can be a speaker or members can present stages separately in one session.
* All group members are expected on the board while presenting. Absent members will be penalized according to excuse.
* Group members help each other to hook their computer to the projector quickly.
* Members (and groups) who are not contributed at all, and do not show up at presentation will get 0 (zero) grade.


1. Cloud publishing: Running jar file on AWS Cloud
2. Virtualization: Publishing application on AWS using Docker-Compose
3. Continuous deployment: Deploy pipeline using Jenkins
